This project demonstrates how to use Python and Pandas for data exploration by analysing the post-university salaries of graduates based on their majors. The goal is to answer key questions about the value of different college degrees using real-world data.

**Key Objectives**

Paying for a college degree is a major investment—does it pay off? By examining survey data from 1.2 million Americans with only a bachelor’s degree (collected over a year by PayScale Inc.), you’ll use Pandas to answer questions like:

•	Which majors have the highest starting salaries?

•	Which degrees result in the lowest earnings after graduation?

•	Which majors have the greatest earning potential overall?

•	What are the college majors with the lowest financial risk?

•	Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Sciences) degrees tend to yield higher average salaries?

**Techniques Covered**

•	How to explore a Pandas DataFrame

•	Detecting and cleaning NaN (not a number) values

•	Selecting specific columns, rows, and cells

•	Sorting data in DataFrames

•	Grouping data by category using groupby

**Key Learnings**

•	Use .head(), .tail(), .shape, and .columns to explore your DataFrame and understand its structure.

•	Identify missing values with .findna() and use .dropna() to clean the data.

•	Access DataFrame columns with df['column name'] or multiple columns with df[['column1', 'column2']].

•	Fetch individual cell values using df['column name'][index] or df['column name'].loc[index].

•	Locate the largest and smallest values—and their positions—using .max(), .min(), .idxmax(), and .idxmin().

•	Sort the DataFrame with .sort_values() and add columns using .insert().

•	Create Excel-style pivot tables by grouping data with .groupby().

**GitHub Repository Organization**

To ensure easy navigation and exploration, solutions and Data are neatly organized in a structured GitHub repository.
